# Preface
Dear Chris Dixon,

The projects in your course have helped me become more productive! Before your course, I was wasting so much time figuring out what to do and how to spend my time on my projects. Thank you for your instructions on how to be organized and stay on schedule. I will be recommending your course often!

Best regards,
